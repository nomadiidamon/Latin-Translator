This is a passion project that is currently only being worked on by myself. 
Its purpose is to be able to accurately transfer text between English and Latin and vice versa based off of Classical Latin grammar rules.

In my time teaching Latin, I observed many students try to use translation programs in the completion of assignments. 
It was always evident when this was the case due to the failing of many of those programs not being able to understand the rules of the language. 
My goal is to create a program that can accurately interpret those rules and apply them in the translation of sentences, and hopefully in the future, full texts. 
The goal is to create a solid API that can be used on both a personal and academic level. 

The backend of the API is beign developed in C++, and it will be utilizing a SQL database for the storage of all Latin words along with their vairous forms.
I plan to host the database on a private server that users of the API can access through code.

If in reviewing this repo, you notice any glaring issues or have any suggestions, please feel free to make a pull request- any and all advise is greatly welcomed. 
If you have knowledge of Classical Latin and feel as if any lingual changes should be made, I too implore you to share your feedback.

Lastly, if you are simply intersted in learning about the procress of translating Latin, feel free to send me a message as well.
