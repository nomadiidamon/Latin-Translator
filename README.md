I am a single indivdual working on this project. Its purpose is to be able to accurately transfer text between English and Latin based off of Classical Latin grammar rules.
At the time of writting this, I have a temporary teaching certificate in the state of Florida for teaching Classical Latin to 6th-12th grade students.
In my time teaching, I observed many students try to use translation programs in the completion of assignments. It was always evident when this was the case due to
the failing of many of those programs not being able to understand the rules of the language. My goal is to create a program that can accurately interpret those rules and 
apply them in the translation of sentences, and hopefully in the future, full texts. 

As mentioned, I am working on this project on my own and I am aware that my knowledge is not all encompassing. 

If in reviewing this repo, you notice any glaring issues regarding programming syntax or best practices, please feel free to make a pull request- any and all advise is greatly welcomed. 
Also, if you have knowledge of Classical Latin and feel as if any lingual changes should be made, I too implore you to share your feedback.

Note on Branching: As I do not expect many people to be contributing to this repo, I typically will merge things directly from my local repo to main as opposed to a development branch. Going forward I will attempt to better consilidate changes to specific brances to make collaboration more effect.
